# Feed items

The Mondo app is organised around the feed – a reverse-chronological stream of events. Transactions are one such feed item, and your application can create its own feed items to surface relevant information to the user.

It's important to keep a few principals in mind when creating feed items:

1. Feed items are *discrete* events that happen at a *point in time*.
2. Because of their prominence within the Mondo app, feed items should contain information of *high value*.
3. While the appearance of feed items can be customised, care should be taken to match the style of the Mondo app so that your feed items feel part of the experience.

## (POST) Create feed item

```shell
$ http --form POST "https://api.getmondo.co.uk/feed" \
    "Authorization: Bearer $access_token" \
    "account_id=$account_id" \
    "type=basic" \
    "url=https://www.example.com/a_page_to_open_on_tap.html" \
    "params[title]=My custom item" \
    "params[image_url]=www.example.com/image.png" \
    "params[background_color]=#FCF1EE" \
    "params[body_color]=#FCF1EE" \
    "params[title_color]=#333" \
    "params[body]=Some body text to display"
```

```json
{}
```
